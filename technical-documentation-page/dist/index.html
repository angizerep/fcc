                JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/), often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993. Accessible to non-technical people, it played a prominent role in the rapid growth of the nascent World Wide Web.[15] The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. This quickly became the most-used.
            </p>

            <p>
                Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                </li>
                <li>
                Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.

                JavaScript supports much of the structured programming syntax from C 
                (e.g., if statements, while loops, switch statements, do while loops, etc.). 
                One partial exception is scoping: originally JavaScript only had function 
                scoping with var; then block scoping was added in ECMAScript 2015 with the 
                keywords let and const. Like C, JavaScript makes a distinction between 
                expressions and statements. One syntactic difference from C is automatic 
                semicolon insertion, which allow semicolons (which terminate statements) 
                to be omitted.

                    The binary + operator casts both operands to a string unless both operands are numbers. 
                    This is because the addition operator doubles as a concatenation operator

                The syntax of JavaScript is the set of rules that define a correctly structured JavaScript program.
            </p>
            <p>
                The examples below make use of the log function of the console object present in most browsers for standard text output.
            </p>
            <p>
                The JavaScript standard library lacks an official standard text output function (with the exception of document.write). Given that JavaScript is mainly used for client-side scripting within modern web browsers, and that almost all Web browsers provide the alert function, alert can also be used, but is not commonly used.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <h4>Case sensitivity</h4>
                <code>
                    var a=5;
                    console.log(a); // 5
                    console.log(A); // throws a ReferenceError: A is not defined
                </code>
            </p>

            <p>
                <h4>Whitespace and semicolons</h4>
                <code>
                    a = b + c
                    (d + e).foo()
                    
                    // Treated as:
                    //  a = b + c(d + e).foo();
                </code>
            </p>

            <p>
                <h4>Comments</h4>
                <code>
                    // a short, one-line comment

                    /* this is a long, multi-line comment
                        about my script. May it one day
                        be great. */
                    
                    /* Comments /* may not be nested */ Syntax error */
                </code>
            </p>

            <p>
                <h4>Scoping and hoisting</h4>
                <code>
                    var func = function() { .. } // declaration is hoisted only
                    function func() { .. } // declaration and assignment are hoisted
                </code>
            </p>

            <p>
                <h4>Undefined</h4>
                <code>
                    var test;                         // variable declared, but not defined, ...
                </code>
            </p>

            <p>
                <h4>Number</h4>
                <code>
                    console.log(0.2 + 0.1 === 0.3); // displays false
                    console.log(0.94 - 0.01);       // displays 0.9299999999999999

                JavaScript and the DOM provide the potential for malicious authors to deliver scripts to run on a client computer via the Web. Browser authors minimize this risk using two restrictions. 
            </p>
            <p>
                First, scripts run in a sandbox in which they can only perform Web-related actions, not general-purpose programming tasks like creating files. Second, scripts are constrained by the same-origin policy: scripts from one Web site do not have access to information such as usernames, passwords, or cookies sent to another site. Most JavaScript-related security bugs are breaches of either the same origin policy or the sandbox.

                    Every major web browser has built-in web development tools, including a JavaScript debugger.               
                </li>
                <li>
                    Static program analysis tools, such as ESLint and JSLint, scan JavaScript code for conformance to a set of standards and guidelines.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Some browsers have built-in profilers. Stand-alone profiling libraries have also been created, such as benchmark.js and jsbench.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Many text editors have syntax highlighting support for JavaScript code.
