✔ User Story #1: My tribute page should have an element with a
corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements.

✔ User Story #2: I should see an element with a corresponding
id="title", which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes
the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").

✔ User Story #3: I should see a div element with a corresponding
id="img-div".

✔ User Story #4: Within the img-div element, I should see an img
element with a corresponding id="image".

✔ User Story #5: Within the img-div element, I should see an 
element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains
textual content describing the image shown in img-div.

✔ User Story #6: I should see an element with a corresponding 
id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing 
the subject of the tribute page.

✔ User Story #7: I should see an a element with a corresponding 
id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site that contains
additional information about the subject of the tribute page. 
HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set 
it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab 
(i.e. target="_blank").

✔ User Story #8: The img element should responsively resize, 
relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding 
its original size.
